Should also include comparison mode where the same message is sent to each models opened in each layout for comparison sake. Inspo for split/multi chat: https://x.com/tdinh_me/status/1908862132420219182 and https://ai-sdk.dev/playground

--- OTHERS ---
⏳ Latex formatting support for rendered messages in MessageList/MultiAIResponseCarousel
⏳ Using Vercel's AI SDK and fixing the following: 
    ⏳ Fix attachments, artifacts, image and video gen
    ⏳ Allow adding/removing attachments while editing messages (Current "in progress" in T3 Chat though)
    ⏳ Artifacts & Attachment management for previously uploaded attachments to chats and Media Library for AI-generated media from chats. Ability to reference attachments/artifacts/media from library in any chat (while typing in MessageInput) using "#" command
    ⏳ Some crazy/advanced media library search and filter! Searching anything! And being able to filter by anything (chats, projects and so on!)

- More info on Attachments/artifacts/media management from users concerns:
(1) I have a bunch of attachments that I have to recall in different chats, every new chat I create I have to “upload” them again.

As you already have all the attachments saved on “https://t3.chat/settings/attachments”, I think it would be useful to mirror it into an “Attachments library” on the main interface where I can favorite and select what attachments (That I already uploaded to the site) I want to include on the context window of the selected chat.

If you add the option to manage the “active attachments” in a given chat it could be very useful.

examples:

- Removing an attachment that was previously uploaded
- Replacing an attachment for an updated version (instead of  having to insert a duplicate)
- Just selecting already uploaded attachments…

It would help a lot on my academic and copywriting workflow

PS: By removing, replacing and selecting I mean to include/exclude it from the context window of the chat that is opened.

(2) I would also suggest that attachments have a reference to the chat they were used, or vice-versa. 

This way we could easily navigate to the chats that attachment was used. It would also make it easier to track which attachments are no longer linked to any chat and are safe to delete. Along with that you would, when deleting an attachment you would be aware of what chats will be impacted and would also be nice to be able to delete these chats as well.

--- NEW -----
- "@" mentions should be used to tag/mention custom GPTs/plugings/agents, we can resort to using # for referencing artifacts (inspo from https://www.typingmind.com/)
- Users being able to define tool calls, stored in their settings and able to mention or tag them the way they do for the GPTs/plugins (maybe there's some overlap here)
